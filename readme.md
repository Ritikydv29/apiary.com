# APIARY

One of the key benefits of Apiary is that it is entirely free to use. The site is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and straightforward interface that makes it easy to navigate. Additionally, Apiary is especially useful for developers who are just starting out in programming, as the site's cheat sheets and code playground features make it easy for beginners to learn and practice programming without having to invest in expensive software or tools.

Being CS students we learn new technologies, programming languages, frameworks,
etc. This process can prove to be quite tricky for beginners. Thus we often seek help from
online resources like documentation, forums, etc. All the platforms serving this purpose
are either too tangled and complicated or out of date and poorly arranged.  For instance, if
you’re beginning with python and you’re struggling with all the functions, libraries,
methods, etc., wouldn't you love it if there was a single destination for all your needs.
Websites like Geeks For Geeks,  Java Tutorial Point, etc., do the job well enough, but they
lack simplicity, organization, and customizability. Imagine a website that would do what
these websites do but is simpler in UI and uses, complete and regularly updated, and fully
customized according to your specific needs. Another problem that a user might come
across is how overwhelming all the data these websites bomb you with. A better
approach would be revealing data only queried or according to the user’s very particular
needs. Another problem may be as follows. Suppose you search for a function that
helps you with finding prime numbers. What any website would do is tell you how the
function works, what are the input fields and what are the output fields. But more often
than not they explain how these functions work, what is the algorithm behind them and
what subroutines are incorporated under those functions. This, although is
often ignored by users who want to just use the functions and libraries, maybe a point of
interest for many curious minds. These are some of the problems that I as a student have
come across. These are some functions I always wanted in a website. Simple, robust, and
personalized.
This is where our project comes in. APIARY, an abbreviation of an API Library, is aimed
to do the same. APIARY will be a single-stop tending to language documentation,
customized recommendations and API support, and much much more. It is aimed to be all
any CS student might need and will prove to come in handy.

**Roadmap:**

We will be adding many more languages to the website and also we will be using AI to enhance user’s experience on our websites also we will use that AI to suggest users courses , free as well as paid courses that will help users achieve great mastery over the languages and topics they want to learn.  also will be expanding our servers to keep our website open and running all the time so that users can have seemed less experience with our website.
